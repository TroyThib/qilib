	<p>You&rsquo;ve just started, so you won&rsquo;t see results in progress this week. However, we&rsquo;ll continue to talk about expectations as they change from week to week. You may see progress sooner than expected or it may take a little longer than you thought. Either way, it&rsquo;s important to stay flexible and positive during the process. Remember, results vary from person to person so don&rsquo;t get discouraged if you don&rsquo;t see progress right away. <b>Visible results may be seen in as little as 4 weeks.</b></p>
