	<p>You’ve just started, so you won’t see results in progress this week. However, we’ll continue to talk about expectations as they change from week to week. You may see progress sooner than expected or it may take a little longer than you thought. Either way, it’s important to stay flexible and positive during the process. Remember, results vary from person to person so don’t get discouraged if you don’t see progress right away. <b>Visible results may be seen in as little as 4 weeks.</b></p>
