					<div class="sectionSubContent"><p>Did you know that 80% of men and 40% of women experience hair loss or that 1 in 4 suffer from some form of sleep problem? Coincidence? Our bodies need sleep to function. It&rsquo;s precisely when our systems recharge with electrolytes and replenish energy. If we don&rsquo;t get enough sleep at night, our immune system, due to lack of nutrients, becomes weak. This can cause roots to become weak which can lead to hair loss and balding. So, make sure to get your 8 hours!</p></div>
