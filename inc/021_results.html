	<p>It’s already Week 2. You’re off to a great start. This is when we’re often asked whether or not the Hair Regrowth Treatment works by itself. The qilib Hair Regrowth and Revitalization system is designed as a dual action system. So to get the best results and the fuller, healthier, thicker-looking hair you deserve, it’s important that you use both products together, twice daily.</b></p>
