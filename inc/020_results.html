	<p>It&rsquo;s already Week 2. You&rsquo;re off to a great start. This is when we&rsquo;re often asked whether or not the Hair Regrowth Treatment works by itself. The qilib Hair Regrowth and Revitalization system is designed as a dual action system. So to get the best results and the fuller, healthier, thicker-looking hair you deserve, it&rsquo;s important that you use both products together, twice daily.</b></p>
