	<p>Have you noticed more hair loss than usual?  Don&rsquo;t worry, it means your products are working. Your qilib Hair Regrowth Treatment is stimulating new growth deep within your follicles. This means it&rsquo;s potentially pushing older hair out. So, you may be experiencing more shedding while waiting for your new hair to grow in. Be patient and remember to stick with your action plan for best results.</p>
